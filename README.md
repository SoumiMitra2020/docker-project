# docker-project

To run the docker-compose file, run the following command:

docker-compose up -d

I've created the following containers:

NGINX

prometheus

alertmanager

prom2teams

I've created the containers in such a way that if NGINX is down, one alert will trigger at prometheus. Then the alert will be shown at Alertmanager UI and Prom2Team UI respectively.

# Reference:

Iâ€™ve taken reference from the following to implement this project.
